## üöÄ Features

- **Page-based modular design**  
  Three main pages:  
  - **General Overview (Page0):** Displays top customers, regional sales distribution (pie chart), monthly sales totals (bar chart), monthly order counts (line chart), and summary boxes for total sales, customers, and orders.  
  - **Customer Analysis (Page1):** Shows a searchable customer list with total spending, detailed past orders, active customer charts (yearly/monthly/weekly), and statistics like average basket size.  
  - **Product Analysis (Page2):** Lists sold products and stock items with category filters, product-specific sales charts (yearly/monthly/weekly), and stock vs. sales pie charts.

- **Advanced filtering and search**  
  Dynamic category filters with checkboxes, date range filtering, and instant search functionality for customers and products.

- **Interactive data visualization**  
  Multiple chart types (pie, bar, line) for sales and stock analysis, with dynamic updates based on user-selected year and filters.

- **Cross-platform support**  
  Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with responsive layouts and vertical scrolling for mobile screens.

- **Database flexibility**  
  Developed with two versions of the codebase to support both **SQLite** (lightweight, file-based usage) and **SQL Server** (centralized, multi-user environment). Users can run the application with either database without losing functionality.

- **Real-time updates**  
  Charts, lists, and statistics update instantly upon filter or selection changes without page reloads.
